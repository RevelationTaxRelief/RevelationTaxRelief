Services</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Revelation Tax Relief operates exclusively as a consultation service providing case-by-case, nonspecific advisory discussions, opinions, and general information related to tax matters (“Consultation Services”). Consultation Services consist only of verbal or written advice, informational exchanges, or guidance delivered during paid consultation sessions or communications. </p><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">At our sole, absolute, and unfettered discretion, we may elect — on a case-by-case basis and without any obligation — to perform certain additional activities sometimes associated with tax relief or tax resolution companies (such as document review assistance, preparation support, communication facilitation, or other discretionary tasks). No such additional activities are promised, required, guaranteed, expected, or included in the baseline Consultation Services for which fees are charged. We retain complete discretion to perform, decline, limit, modify, delay, or discontinue any optional activities at any time, for any reason, without notice, explanation, liability, or impact on fees. </p><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">No specific deliverables, documents, forms, submissions, filings, negotiations, representations before any agency, communications with tax authorities, applications, appeals, abatement requests, research, analysis, strategy development, or any other tangible, traceable, or verifiable body of work is promised, required, performed as standard, or guaranteed. No particular depth, duration beyond paid time, follow-up, or outcome is assured. </p><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">All Consultation Services (and any discretionary additional activities we may or may not elect to provide) are deemed fully, irrevocably, satisfactorily, and completely rendered immediately upon receipt and acceptance of payment and/or the provision of any consultation time, call, message, email, communication, or session whatsoever. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">2. Fees & Irrevocable Payment</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">All fees are charged exclusively for consultation time and advisory services rendered. Any optional discretionary activities we may choose to perform are provided gratuitously or as an extension of paid consultation and do not create additional obligations or alter the fee structure. Fees are earned in full upon receipt and are absolutely non-refundable, non-creditable, non-transferable, and non-reversible under any circumstance, theory, or forum, including but not limited to perceived value, lack of follow-up, dissatisfaction, non-use of advice, decision not to perform discretionary activities, change of circumstances, or any other basis. </p><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">By tendering payment you: </p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg"><li>Irrevocably acknowledge and agree that Consultation Services have been initiated and fully rendered to the extent of paid time;</li><li>Expressly and forever waive and release any right to dispute, reverse, reclaim, chargeback, clawback, or seek return of funds through any payment method, processor, issuer, bank, card network, or other entity;</li><li>Certify that this transaction is authorized by you personally and not made using any third-party, stolen, or unauthorized payment instrument;</li><li>Agree that any attempt to initiate a chargeback, dispute, reversal, reclamation, unauthorized transaction claim, or similar recovery action — at any time and regardless of delay — constitutes intentional fraud and material breach, subjecting you to immediate liability for all resulting damages, fees, penalties, and costs (including processor penalties, investigation fees, legal fees, collection costs, and treble damages where applicable).</li></ul></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">3. No Representations or Warranties</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Revelation Tax Relief makes absolutely no representation, warranty, covenant, or guarantee — express, implied, statutory, or otherwise — regarding the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, applicability, performance of any discretionary activities, outcome of any advice, eligibility for any tax program (federal or state), or any other aspect of tax-related matters. All advice and any optional support we may elect to provide is general and informational only. Client assumes sole responsibility for all decisions, actions, inactions, and consequences. No specific result, relief, reduction, abatement, settlement, or resolution is promised, contemplated, or guaranteed. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">4. Client Obligations</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">You may provide whatever information you choose during consultation; Revelation Tax Relief has no duty to verify, retain, document, follow up, or act upon it. Any failure, delay, or inaction on your part creates no refund entitlement or exception to these Terms. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">5. Absolute Limitation of Liability</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Revelation Tax Relief's aggregate liability under any theory shall in no event exceed zero dollars ($0.00) beyond the amount actually received from you. Revelation Tax Relief shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or other damages whatsoever, including without limitation tax assessments, penalties, interest, liens, levies, legal expenses, lost opportunities, or emotional harm. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">6. Mandatory Binding Arbitration & Class Action Waiver</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Any claim, controversy, or dispute arising from or relating to these Terms, any payment, any consultation, or any discretionary activity shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, conducted in the State of California at a location designated by Provider. You waive any right to a jury trial, to participate in any class, collective, or representative action, and to any appeal except as minimally provided by JAMS rules. Provider shall be entitled to recover all costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing these Terms or defending any chargeback, dispute, or related action on a prevailing-party basis. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">7. Conclusive Evidence Clause</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">You agree that the following shall constitute irrefutable, conclusive, and binding evidence that Consultation Services (and any discretionary activities) were fully performed and that no refund, reversal, or recovery is due, regardless of when any dispute is raised: </p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg"><li>Any record of payment receipt, transaction confirmation, or processor metadata;</li><li>Any timestamp, log entry, call duration record, email/message timestamp, session identifier, auto-response delivery receipt, or other notation of consultation, communication, or activity generated at any time;</li><li>These Terms combined with proof of payment or any engagement;</li><li>Any automated or manual follow-up communication sent post-payment.</li></ul><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">You irrevocably waive any right to challenge the sufficiency, authenticity, admissibility, or probative value of such evidence in any forum. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">8. Governing Law & Venue</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">These Terms are governed exclusively by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Exclusive venue for any non-arbitrable matter (if any) lies in the State of California. </p></section><section><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">9. Entirety & Survival</h2><p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">These Terms constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings.
